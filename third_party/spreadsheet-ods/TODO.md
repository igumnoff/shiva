# NEAR TERM

- text.rs: add ruby tag

- cell: table:protected

# MAYBE



# FAR FUTURE

- On the spreadsheet level still missing are scripts, tracked-changes,
  variable-decls, sequence-decls, user-field-decls, dde-connection-decls,
  calculation-settings, label-ranges, named-expressions, database-ranges,
  data-pilot-tables, consolidation and dde-links.
  Anyway they are conserved during a read/write cycle.

- On the single table level still missing are dde-source, scenario, forms,
  shapes, named-expressions.
  They are also conserved during a read/write cycle.

- There is also no current plan to add charts and drawings.

- Support to parse/create formulas will be bigger projects, and I will rather
  support them with additional crates. There are some blueprints lying around
  but they need more work.

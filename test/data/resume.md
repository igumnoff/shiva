Experience
---------
**Data Scientist, Upwork (part-time)** (2017-2018)

- Built machine learning models in Python to inform business decisions like "How long should we leave jobs open before expiring?" and "Should this job be moved to the US-only marketplace?"
- Identified two major data leaks in a pre-existing model that impacted runtime accuracy.
- Provided insights on how client and freelancer behavior evolves during the lifetime of a job post by ingesting data from PostgreSQL and performing cleaning/analysis in Python.
- Created reports/presentations to communicate insights to both technical and non-technical staff.

**Freelance Data Scientist** (2017-2019)

- Assisted a client with MCMC Bayesian parameter estimation using PyMC and corresponding visualizations for experimental chemistry data; results contributed to a [published paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.9b01234).
- Enabled a client to analyze patterns in financial transactions by building a Python module to aggregate data, create summary statistics and visualizations, and automatically email reports.
- Provided a client with insights on user behavior for a nutrition/workout tracking mobile app by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis and PCA with clustering.


**Graduate Researcher, Yale University** (2012-2018)

- Designed and executed experiments in 3 main projects, all resulting in publications.
- Performed simulation and data analysis with Python, MATLAB, and C++.
- Improved documentation and training for lab protocols, and maintained the internal lab wiki and Unix server.
- Trained and managed 4 undergraduate assistants, resulting in successful senior projects.


**Medical College Admission Test Instructor, Kaplan Test Prep** (2011-2012)

- Planned and delivered lectures on undergraduate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

Projects
--------
**Web App** [*GeekBuddy Social Graph and Buddy Finder*](http://sdsawtelle.pythonanywhere.com) (2017)

- Designed and built a web application using Web2Py framework and d3.js that displays the social graph for a user on www.boardgamegeek.com and colors nodes by correlation to the user as computed from boardgame ratings. Data was collected by a combination of web scraping and API querying and stored as a sqlite database.

**Website & Technical Blog** [*Exploring Data Science and Python*](http://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/index.html) (2015-present)

- Designed and built a personal website for hosting useful technical articles using HTML/CSS and GitHub Pages. Authored a series of educational posts on various programming and data science topics using Jupyter Notebooks and Pelican page generator.
